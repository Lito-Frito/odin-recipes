# Odin Project: Recipies for daily life

## Description

This is a sample web project, made by following the cirriculum of The Odin Project. This is currently being worked on, so pardon the dust, so to speak. 
More will be added as I brush up on my HTML and CSS. 

Once finished, this will be a web page that features a myriad of recipies from varied cooks and cuisine for daily life.

I will also maintain a template version of this repo so users can clone it and then create a version with their own recipes.

<!-- ## Installation --> 

<!-- Within a particular ecosystem, there may be a common way of installing things, such as using Yarn, NuGet, or Homebrew. However, consider the possibility that whoever is reading your README is a novice and would like more guidance. Listing specific steps helps remove ambiguity and gets people to using your project as quickly as possible. If it only runs in a specific context like a particular programming language version or operating system or has dependencies that have to be installed manually, also add a Requirements subsection.

## Usage

Feel free to visit my site if you want to see some potentially new recipes to try out.

<!-- 
State if you are open to contributions and what your requirements are for accepting them.

For people who want to make changes to your project, it's helpful to have some documentation on how to get started. Perhaps there is a script that they should run or some environment variables that they need to set. Make these steps explicit. These instructions could also be useful to your future self.

You can also document commands to lint the code or run tests. These steps help to ensure high code quality and reduce the likelihood that the changes inadvertently break something. Having instructions for running tests is especially helpful if it requires external setup, such as starting a Selenium server for testing in a browser.
